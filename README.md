# Attrition-Analysis
A data analysis project wherein I use a binomial logistic regression model to predict employee turnover.

# Project Background
The HR department of Salifort Motors wants to know which factors make an employee leave the company. Seeing as it is costly and time-consuming to interview, hire, and train an employee.

In this project, my objectives are to: <br/>

  • Analyze the collected data to uncover patterns associated with employee attrition. <br/>
  • Develop a predictive model that forecasts whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

Once this has been accomplished, the company will be able to pinpoint factors that lead to its employee turnover and will be able to provide solutions on increasing an employee's retention and ultimately be beneficial to the company.

For the full exploratory data analysis and model building, you can find the Jupyter Notebook here.

# Executive Summary
It has been observed that employee turnover largely ties in with various management issues within the company.

Critical findings are as follows:

  • There is a noticeable constant increase in the count of employees that leave related to the number of average monthly hours. Alarmingly, all employees that have worked on 7 projects have left. This may infer that overworking plays a factor in employee turnover rates. <br/>
  
  • Majority of the employees that have stayed only worked on 3-5 projects and worked around the total mean of average monthly hours (200). This may signify a comfortable working setup for retaining employees.
