# Attrition-Analysis
A data analysis project wherein I use a binomial logistic regression model to predict employee turnover.

# Project Background
Salifort Motors' HR department is focused on boosting employee satisfaction to improve retention. The main goal for this project is to examine the data and identify patterns that might predict employee attrition.

The HR team has a pressing question: What factors are driving employees to leave?

The objectives of this project are: 

  • Analyze the collected data to uncover patterns associated with employee attrition. <br/>
  • Develop a predictive model that forecasts whether an employee is likely to leave the company.
  
If successful, your analysis and model will enable the HR department to proactively address potential retention risks by targeting the key factors linked to turnover. With hiring being both costly and time-consuming, improving employee retention will yield significant savings and strengthen the overall workforce.
