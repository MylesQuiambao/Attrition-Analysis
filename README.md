A data analysis project wherein I use a binomial logistic regression model to predict employee turnover.

# Project Background
The HR department of Salifort Motors wants to know which factors make an employee leave the company. Seeing as it is costly and time-consuming to interview, hire, and train an employee.

In this project, my objectives are to: <br/>

  • Analyze the collected data to uncover patterns associated with employee attrition. <br/>
  • Develop a predictive model that forecasts whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

Once this has been accomplished, the company will be able to pinpoint factors that lead to employee turnover, provide solutions to increase employee retention, and ultimately benefit the company.

For the full exploratory data analysis and model building, you can find the Jupyter Notebook here.

# Executive Summary
It has been observed that employee turnover largely ties in with various management issues within the company.

Critical findings are as follows:

  • There is a noticeable constant increase in the number of employees that leave related to the average monthly hours. Alarmingly, all employees that have worked on 7 projects have left. This may infer that overworking plays a factor in employee turnover rates. <br/>
  
  • The majority of the employees who have stayed only worked on 3-5 projects and worked around the total mean of average monthly hours (200). This may signify a comfortable working setup for retaining employees.

  • Employees who have worked ~240-320 average monthly hours are the ones who have the lowest satisfaction levels. These are most likely the employees who have worked on the most projects. <br/>
  
  • Another group of employees that have left can be noticed along the average monthly hours range of ~130-160 which can be possibly identified as employees unmotivated to work enough to reach the mean levels of average monthly hours.

  • There is a drop in satisfaction levels from employees with a tenure of 4 years. A deeper investigation into policies or benefits in a 4-year tenure may be suggested as this may be a critical factor for turnover.

  • The fluctuations of salary levels among levels of tenure don't seem to scale positively. This shows that salary levels don't necessarily increase over time.
