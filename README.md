# Attrition-Analysis
A data analysis project wherein I use a binary logistic regression model to predict employee turnover.

# Project Background
The HR department of Salifort Motors wants to know which factors make an employee leave the company. Seeing as it is costly and time-consuming to interview, hire, and train an employee.

In this project, my objectives are to: <br/>

  • Analyze the collected data to uncover patterns associated with employee attrition. <br/>
  • Develop a predictive model that forecasts whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

Once this has been accomplished, the company will be able to pinpoint to factors that lead to its employees turnover and will be able to provide solutions on increasing an employee's retention and ultimately be beneficial to the company.

For the full exploratory data analysis and model building, you can find the Jupyter Notebook here.
